# My Go Application

This is a simple Go application that demonstrates the structure and organization of a Go project.

## Project Structure

```
my-go-app
├── cmd
│   └── main.go          # Entry point of the application
├── internal
│   └── app
│       └── app.go      # Application lifecycle management
├── pkg
│   └── utils.go        # Utility functions
├── go.mod              # Module dependencies
└── go.sum              # Module dependency checksums
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
